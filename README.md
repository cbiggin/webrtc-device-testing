# webrtc-device-testing
An app created so you can test devices that are plugged into your iPhone (or iPad) and test the differences between accessing through regular `AV` routines or throught `WebRTC` accessors.

This is most notable when accessing the `AVAudioSession`. There appears to be big differences when connecting/disconnecting devices, recording, and playing back.
